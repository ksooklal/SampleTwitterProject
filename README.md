# Twitter API Example

Used the <a href = 'http://dev.twitter.com/' target = '_blank'>Twitter API</a> and the Twitter4J Utility to create a sample Twitter project. I wrote three Java classes 
for the three Twitter accounts that I have, with the ability to send Tweets from each of those accounts. A working example is included which will cast votes for the 2016 NBA All Star game by posting tweets with the pattern "[Player first name] [Player last name] #NBAVote".
